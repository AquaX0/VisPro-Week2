reflection:
i do not know if it's because i still do not understand how to code on dart or it's because my friends do not understand it and decide to use chatgpt and probably did not try to understand it. either way, i clearly see i need to improve more since it took me quite a while to figure out what to do when i saw the flowchart and when i saw my friend's code. when i saw my friend's code i was so confused because it's very different from how i made mine. most of the time i spent in making the code is me trying to make the code myself or try to get a chatgpt response and try to make it like what the flowchart wants.
